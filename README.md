ChunkManager
============

Bukkit plugin which improves the vanilla CraftBukkit chunk sending algorithms, as well as providing more control over chunk sending.

Important note about recent minecraft versions:
===============================================

This project will _not_ be updated for version 1.3/1.4. At least vanilla 1.4 (I didn't check 1.3) already includes all the changes ChunkManager makes, so it's no longer needed in the latest minecraft versions!
